madmon is a UNIX-flavo(u)red modifications manager for the game Heroes of
Newerth, by S2 Games. It reads the .honmod format popularized by the program
"HoN Modification Manager", which works well for .NET platforms, but which is
rather inconvenient to use on Linux.

The code is currently in developer pre-alpha stage. It is capable of applying
some mods, but has not been rigorously tested, and does not support basic
features such as dependency resolution.

Further documentation is forthcoming.
